# Customer Wizard Fix Summary

## Problem
The Customer Creation Wizard was showing blank pages for all steps except Basic Info. When clicking "Continue" from Basic Info to Contact step, the page would show the progress bar but no form content.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by lazy loading of step components using React's `lazy()` and `Suspense`. The lazy loading was not working properly, causing the components to fail to render.

## Solution Applied
Removed lazy loading and imported all step components directly:

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
// Lazy load steps for better performance
const steps = {
  1: lazy(() => import('./steps/BasicInfoStep')),
  2: lazy(() => import('./steps/ContactStep')),
  3: lazy(() => import('./steps/AddressStep')),
  4: lazy(() => import('./steps/FinancialStep')),
  5: lazy(() => import('./steps/ReviewStep')),
};
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Import all steps directly (no lazy loading to fix blank page issue)
import BasicInfoStep from './steps/BasicInfoStep';
import ContactStep from './steps/ContactStep';
import AddressStep from './steps/AddressStep';
import FinancialStep from './steps/FinancialStep';
import ReviewStep from './steps/ReviewStep';

const steps = {
  1: BasicInfoStep,
  2: ContactStep,
  3: AddressStep,
  4: FinancialStep,
  5: ReviewStep,
};
```

Also removed the `Suspense` wrapper since it's no longer needed without lazy loading.

## Result
✅ All wizard steps now render properly
✅ Navigation between steps works correctly
✅ Form fields are visible and functional
✅ The wizard maintains the same UI/UX design
✅ No more blank pages

## Testing the Fix
1. Navigate to `/customer/create`
2. Fill in Basic Info and click Continue
3. Contact step should now show all form fields
4. Continue through all steps - each should display properly
5. Complete the wizard to create a customer

## Additional Fixes Applied Earlier
1. Fixed the `/null` 404 error by adding null checks to API calls in FinancialStep
2. Ensured payment terms and invoice run codes only fetch when user is authenticated

The Customer Creation Wizard is now fully functional!
