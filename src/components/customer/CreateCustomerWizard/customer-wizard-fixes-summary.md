# Customer Creation Wizard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Removed Customer Category and Industry Fields
- **Customer Category**: Initially removed but then discovered it's required by backend as `type`
- **Solution**: Automatically fetch and set a default customer type ID during form submission
- **Industry**: Successfully removed as it's not required by backend

### 2. Fixed Duplicate Navigation Buttons
- **Issue**: Each step had its own "Continue" button plus the WizardNavigation component's button
- **Solution**: Removed individual navigation sections from all steps:
  - BasicInfoStep
  - ContactStep
  - AddressStep
  - FinancialStep
  - ReviewStep (already clean)

### 3. Fixed Step Navigation Not Working
- **Issue**: Validation wasn't being triggered, preventing navigation between steps
- **Solution**: Added useEffect hooks to validate on form data changes in each step:
  ```javascript
  // Example from BasicInfoStep
  useEffect(() => {
    validateStep();
  }, [formData.customerType, formData.companyName, formData.name, formData.lastName]);
  ```

### 4. Backend Compatibility Maintained
- **Type Field**: Maps `customerTypeId` to `type` for backend
- **Status Field**: Automatically sets default value 'active'
- **Default Customer Type**: Fetches available types if none selected

## Current State:
- ✅ Clean UI without unnecessary fields
- ✅ Single navigation button per step
- ✅ All 5 steps accessible and functional
- ✅ Backend compatibility maintained
- ✅ Validation works properly

## Wizard Steps:
1. **Basic Info** - Company/Individual details (no category/industry)
2. **Contact** - Email, phone, communication preferences
3. **Address** - Billing and delivery addresses
4. **Financial** - Payment terms, invoice settings
5. **Review** - Final review and submission
