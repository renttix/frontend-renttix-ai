            Data Processing Agreement (DPA)
          </p>
          <p >
            This Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is a key part of the overall
            Agreement between Renttix.com (referred to as the “Processor”) and
            our valued customer (referred to as the “Controller”). Together,
            we’re known as the “Parties” and individually as “Party.”
          </p>
        <br />
          <p >
            This DPA clarifies how we’ll handle and protect personal data while
            providing you with our services.
          </p>
        <br />
          <p >Why We’re Here</p>
        <br />
          <p >
            You, the Controller, have access to personal data from various
            individuals (which we call “Data Subjects”).
          </p>
          <p >
            To help you manage your data responsibly, we (Renttix) will carry
            out certain processing tasks for you, according to the terms of our
            Agreement.
          </p>
          <p >
            In this DPA, terms like “personal data” and “processing” follow the
            definitions outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation
            (GDPR).
          </p>
          <p >
            Our role as the Processor is to handle personal data on your behalf,
            as part of the services we provide under our Agreement with you.
            You, as the Controller, hold the primary responsibility for ensuring
            that data is processed securely and in line with GDPR standards.
          </p>
        <br />
          <p >

          <p >
            1.1. Renttix will process personal data strictly to fulfill our
            Agreement with you, whether that’s managing your rentals, invoicing,
            or other related services. Processing may also occur if legally
            required.
          </p>
        <br />
          <p >
            1.2. The types of data and categories of individuals involved are
            outlined in Appendix A.
          </p>
        <br />
          <p >
            2. Our Responsibilities as Processor

          <p >
            2.1. Renttix will only process personal data for the agreed-upon
            purposes outlined above.
          </p>
        <br />
          <p >
            2.2. We’ll always comply with GDPR requirements in everything we do
            regarding personal data.
          </p>
        <br />
          <p >
            2.3. If we believe that any instruction you provide conflicts with
            GDPR or is otherwise unreasonable, we’ll inform you promptly.
          </p>
        <br />
          <p >
            2.4. As the Processor, we’re committed to supporting you in
            fulfilling your GDPR obligations. This includes providing necessary
            assistance for tasks like data protection impact assessments and
            breach notifications (Articles 32–36 of the GDPR).
          </p>
        <br />
          <p >
            2.5. Our commitment to protecting personal data extends to any team
            members or third parties who process data on our behalf.
          </p>
        <br />
          <p >
            3. Keeping Data Confidential

          </p>
        <br />
          <p >
            3.2. Confidentiality may only be waived if you explicitly authorize
            it, it’s necessary to provide our services, or if we’re legally
            required to disclose the data.
          </p>

            4.2. To help you fulfill this responsibility, Renttix will promptly
            notify you of any known breach within 48 hours of discovery. We’ll
            also take reasonable steps to limit any damage and prevent further
            issues.

        <br />
          <p >

            actions related to the breach.

            their data, we’ll forward it to you within three working days.

        <br />
          <p >
            7.1 If you need to verify our compliance, you can arrange for an
            independent third-party audit once per year. This audit can only
            happen if there’s a valid reason, which should be communicated in
            writing.

        <br />
          <p >
